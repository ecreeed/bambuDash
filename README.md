# BambuDash

BambuDash is a minimalist dashboard designed for real-time monitoring of multiple Bambu printers. Optimized for quick readability at a glance, it primarily supports the X1 series but is compatible with all Bambu printers.

Known issue at the moment with the video feed being slow to load resulting in the rest of the page becoming fix, mainly an issue for low latancy. Will try to fix ASAP.
